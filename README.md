# GNU  Clyde
program to configure programs in pacman. GNU Linux ARCH

 configure dependency environment library is acronim CLYDE and is ghost of pacman.

 Clyde is the orange ghost and the slowest of the four. Sometimes he chases Pac-Man, but at other times he walks away from him and heads towards a corner of the maze.
